## File Explanation

### 1) Report

- A PDF of a detailed report regarding our findings for the loan approval predictor.
  
### 2) src

#### a) Part 1: EDA and Data Wrangling

- An .ipynb file made using Python to clean, transform and analyze the data.
  
#### b) Part 2: Machine Learning

- An .ipynb file made using Python to create 3 different machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) to predict whether or not an application will be approved for a loan.
  
#### c) AI Models (plk files)

- plk files of the AI models described above.
